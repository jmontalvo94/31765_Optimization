# 31765 - Optimization in Modern Power Systems
This repository is intended for the group assignments of the course '31765 - Optimization in Modern Power Systems' at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). It contains the Matlab scripts and data for assignment 1 and 2. See Spyros Chatzivasileiadis' [webpage](http://www.chatziva.com/teaching.html) for further information on the course.

## Program
The project is coded in [Matlab R2019b](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

## Assignment 1
The goal of this assignment was to implement an Economic Dispatch and a DC-OPF, that is an optimal power flow based on the linearized power 
flow equations, and investigate their properties.

## Assignment 2: AC-OPF with convex relaxations (SDP-OPF)
The goal of this assignment was to implement the semidefinite relaxation of the AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF), investigate its properties and compare it to the non-linear, non-convex AC-OPF.

## Authors
The coding was done mainly by me and Andr√©s Viloria.
